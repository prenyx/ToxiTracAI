## Overview 

In this project, we analyze heart rate data from intoxicated and non-intoxicated individuals to create a machine-learning model for detecting changes in heart rate.  
### Features: 
- Data Preparation: Consolidation and processing of raw data. 
- Model Training: Neural network for classifying normal and abnormal states. 
- Easy application via `main.py`.

## Installation 

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prenyx/ToxiTracAI.git
   cd ToxiTracAI
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage 

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   In the notebook `data_preparation.ipynb`, the heart rate data from intoxicated and non-intoxicated individuals has been consolidated. However, this data is not yet fully prepared; only the **normal BPM data** is used.

2. **Model Application:**  
   To run the program, simply execute the `main.py` file. This initializes the **ToxitracAI class**, which loads the prepared model and makes predictions based on the input BPM data.  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Example Output:**  
   - Input the minimum and maximum BPM values as well as the current condition (e.g., "resting").  
   - The model will return whether the state is recognized as "active" or "normal."

## Notes on Data and Model Organization 

1. **Model Files:**  
   Model files are located in the `models/` folder, including the trained model (`heart_nn_normalrate_model2.keras`) and the scaler (`scaler_nn_model2.joblib`).  
   All model paths are dynamically configured through the `config.py` file, allowing them to be used independently of the system.

2. **Dataset Folder:**  
   The `datasets/` folder contains some example datasets that can be used for evaluating the model.

3. **Wavelet Data:**  
   The `wavelet-transform/` folder contains experimental EKG data for **normal BPM values**, which could be expanded in future iterations of the project.

4. **Model Training:**  
   The `model-training/` folder contains all relevant codes and notebooks for training the neural network, including data splitting, feature scaling, and model optimization.

## Future Developments 

- Integration of intoxicated data into model training. 
- Validation of the model using a larger and more diverse dataset. 
- Optimization of the neural network to improve accuracy.
